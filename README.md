# Puzzle
I just wanted to take a small break before making more fun projects. This time around, I just wanted to make something short because I felt exhausted after finishing Wisteria. I want to set a reminder that this doesn't have every feature there is in Bejeweled, as you can only move crystals if there is a possibility for three in a row or more.
